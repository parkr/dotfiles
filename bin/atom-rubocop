# The Atom Rubocop linter cannot for the life of it figure out how best to
# run Rubocop. This shim helps with the following situations:
#   1. Rubocop is run in a directory without a Gemfile.
#   2. Rubocop is run in a directory with binstubs.
#   3. Rubocop is installed globally.
#
# We want the $@.
